# Autoencoder-based anomaly detection

Building of a simple autoencoder to detect anomalies (and quantify the degree of abnormality) using the TensorFlow framework.
The model presented here is a simple autoencoder with one hidden layer. The number of neurons in the hidden layer is equal to the input-output layers.
The sigmoid activation function is used for all layers. The reconstruction error 􏰇is assessed using the mean squared error estimator.
The model is used to predict sector configuration transitions, as described in the ICRAT 2018 paper.
